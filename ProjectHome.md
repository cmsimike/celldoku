# Description #
This is my individual senior project for [Loyola Marymount University](http://www.cs.lmu.edu). Play a Sudoku game on your J2ME-enabled device.

## More Info ##
Please refer to [my blog](http://www.cmsimike.com/blog) entry about [Celldoku](http://www.cmsimike.com/blog/2008/03/10/celldoku-the-j2me-sudoku-experience/) for more info about the game. It is by far and large more verbose about the project itself and I really didn't want to copy the exact same text and have it in two spots.

# Building #
If you are using [Sun's Wireless Toolkit 2.2](http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download-2_2.html) (configured correctly), [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) and [EclipseME](http://www.eclipseme.org) (good tutorial to get you up and running with J2ME, Eclipse, and EclipseME on the site), you should be able to get it building with very little problems. Compile into JAR/JAD and deploy to device.
