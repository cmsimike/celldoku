This is a Sudoku game for any J2ME-compatible device. 
Essentially you need J2ME Wireless Toolkit (WTK) 2.2 from Sun, Eclipse, and 
EclipseME (Eclipse J2ME plugin).

Also this is my actual senior project from a year and a half ago. As such, it
is written to only work correctly on a certain cell phone with certain
dimensions. In the coming months I will hopefully remedy this situation. I love
Sudoku, so having it on any J2ME-compatible device to enjoy at any time will be
great. 

Thank you for checking out Celldoku.

P.S. Additionally, this is my first open source project. Please, be gentle :)
